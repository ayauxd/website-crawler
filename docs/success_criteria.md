# Website Crawler Success Criteria

This document outlines the key success criteria for our website crawler project, serving as a reference for development and evaluation.

## Core Success Criteria

### 1. Complete Website Coverage
- Ability to discover and visit all accessible pages from a single entry URL
- Comprehensive link discovery (navigation menus, footer links, in-text links)
- Support for both static websites and dynamic JavaScript-rendered sites

### 2. Content Extraction Accuracy
- Clean extraction of meaningful content (text, images, headers, tables)
- Removal of boilerplate elements (navigation, footers, ads)
- Preservation of content hierarchy and semantic structure

### 3. Flexible Output Formats
- Markdown for LLM consumption
- HTML for full fidelity
- JSON/structured data for application integration
- Images and media files with proper referencing

### 4. Robustness & Reliability
- Handling of anti-scraping measures
- Respect for robots.txt directives
- Rate limiting to avoid server overload
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms

### 5. Performance & Efficiency
- Parallel processing where appropriate
- Intelligent crawl prioritization
- Memory efficiency for large sites
- Reasonable crawl times even for large websites

### 6. User-Friendly Experience
- Simple API (ideally single function call with a URL)
- Clear progress reporting
- Meaningful error messages
- Customization options for power users

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### 1. URL Frontier & Crawler Engine
- Queue management for URLs to be crawled
- Visited URL tracking
- Domain-specific crawling rules
- URL normalization

### 2. Content Rendering Engine
- Headless browser integration (for JavaScript-heavy sites)
- Document Object Model (DOM) parsing
- Content extraction algorithms

### 3. Data Processing Pipeline
- HTML parsing and cleaning
- Text extraction and formatting
- Image and media processing
- Structured data extraction

### 4. Storage & Output System
- Efficient data storage during crawl
- Format conversion (HTML → Markdown, HTML → JSON)
- File management for outputs
